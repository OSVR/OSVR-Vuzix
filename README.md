This is a plugin for OSVR that provides access to the tracker data on Vuzix HMDs.

It is Windows-only, and requires the Vuzix SDK to build. See <http://www.vuzix.com/support/developer_program/> for details.

Once you have a build, just put the `.dll` file in the same directory of your OSVR server as the other plugins - usually something like `osvr-plugins-0` - and use the config file provided here as an example.
